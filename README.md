### Notes
Had difficulties implementing auto-layout so that the positioning of the logo on the launch screen was predictable across all platforms. My best solution included centering the logo horizontally and vertically on the screen and placing the text a few pixels underneath it (it's hard to see in the gif as the app loads quickly). Also had issues with movie titles extending as much as the screen would allow. After setting right contraints to 0, this was solved.
